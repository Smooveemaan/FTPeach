# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow SemVer.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Honor the uninstaller’s “delete the application data” checkbox: ticking it now removes
  %APPDATA%\FTPeach (settings, sites, known hosts, saved session, logs and the
  vault), and leaving it unticked keeps that data for a reinstall. Updates never delete it.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Open the full site editor when saving a connection or local path, with a folder selector for organizing bookmarks.
- Refine panel, tab, dialog and menu styling, and use theme colors for text selection.

### Fixed

- Correct translations and plural forms across supported languages, with checks for missing plural forms and unknown translation keys.
- Resolve sRGB theme colors correctly for the native window frame.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Initial public version of FTPeach for Windows, with FTP, FTPS, SFTP and WebDAV support.
